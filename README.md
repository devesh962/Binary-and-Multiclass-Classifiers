Classification of Happy-Sad face using Convolutional Neural Network with 9 layers . The dataset Used consist of animated smiley faces with happy or sad expression. This model is not implemented on real life images beacause the dataset used does not contain much images to train the model or to validate the model properly but it works fine on animated smiley faces with training accuracy greater than 99% .

Run the smile.py file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.


 **Binary-Classification-horse-human**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QgRcJAfrADRVsUXsPWqvN5M6a386INhX)

Binary Classification / horse-human using Tensorflow and Keras using InceptionV3 model and adding 4 extra layers at the end.Data augmentation is done using image generator.The link of the dataset is given in the code.
The code is implemented in Google Colab.

The model can also be tested on real life high quality images.

The training Accuracy of the model is 99.8%.

Run the horses_humans_transfer_learning.py file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.


**Binary-Classification-cat-dogs**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_mwoHgo6vXOiFgtA1QoAdVaNr5AHfo2n)

The Classification is done using 8 layered Convolution Neural Network.

Proprocessing is done using OpenCV.

Augmentation is done using Image Generator.

Training vs Validation Accuracy and Loss graphs are plotted using Matplotlib.

Real life high quality images can also be tested.

Run the cat_and_dog.py file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

The second kaggle_augmented_code.py file consist of same code but the dataset used is taken from Kaggle.


 **Mutliclass-Classifier**

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TYI57udcLuzXPvHC93T3ryTw3izgNIWJ)

This Code is Used to identify the Hand gestures for Rock , Paper & Scissors game.The Real life implementation is not done yet because of less training and testing data.

Real life implementation can be done if we have a large dataset.

Run multiclass_classifier.py file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
